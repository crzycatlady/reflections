When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If local environment either gets deleted or crashes, only your local work is lost and not the entire repository. 
	Since everything was stored in the remote repository, you can easily clone the repository in a new environment.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Often many developers can work on multiple features and bugs and constant updates can cause issues with development.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A Fork is cloning a github repository to another github repository, a clone is copying a remote repository to a
	work/local repository. A branch a copy from the master repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    So to avoid conflicts that can lead to difficult merges. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    It would be a lot of meetings or peer reviews between developers looking at code. It would depend other subversions 
	tools I could create a branch and have my fellow developers to review my code before I merge it into master. Merging
	will be tedious task. Git and Github features has defiently makes it a lot easier to commit and merge code.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
